# 3.3 - Control Flow

The most common constructs that let you control the flow of execution of Rust code are `if` expressions and loops.

## `if` Expressions

```rust
fn main() {
    let number = 6;

    if number % 4 == 0 {
        println!("number is divisible by 4");
    } else if number % 3 == 0 {
        println!("number is divisible by 3");
    } else if number % 2 == 0 {
        println!("number is divisible by 2");
    } else {
        println!("number is not divisible by 4, 3, or 2");
    }
}
```

Blocks of code associated with the conditions in `if` expressions are sometimes called *arms*

### Using `if` in a `let` Statement

```rust
fn main() {
    let condition = true;
    let number = if condition { 5 } else { 6 };

    println!("The value of number is: {}", number);
}
```

## Repetition with Loops

The `loop` keyword tells Rust to execute a block of code over and over again forever or until you explicitly tell it to stop.

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut counter = 0;

    let result = loop {
        counter += 1;

        if counter == 10 {
            break counter * 2;
        }
    };

    println!("The result is {}", result);
}
```

You can place the `break` keyword within the loop to tell the program when to stop executing the loop. 

### Conditional Loops with `while`

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut number = 3;
    while number != 0 {
        println!("{}!", number);
        number -= 1;
    }
    println!("LIFTOFF!!!");
}
```

This construct eliminates a lot of nesting that would be necessary if you used `loop`, `if`, `else`, and `break`, and itâ€™s clearer. While a condition holds true, the code runs; otherwise, it exits the loop.

### Looping Through a Collection with `for`

```rust
fn main() {
    let a = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];

    for element in a.iter() {
        println!("the value is: {}", element);
    }
}
```

In chapter 3, we learned about variables, scalar and compound data types, functions, comments, `if` expressions, and loops!
