# Using Structs to Structure Related Data

A **struct** is a custom data type used to name and package together multiple related values that make up a meaningful group.

```rust
struct User {
    username: String,
    email: String,
    sign_in_count: u64,
    active: bool,
}

// To use a struct after it is defined, an instance of that struct must be created by specifying concrete values for each of the fields.
let mut user1 = User {
	email: String::from("someone@example.com"),
	username: String::from("someusername123"),
	active: true,
	sign_in_count: 1,
};

user1.email = String::from("anotheremail@example.com"); // field AND struct must be mutable

let user2 = User {
	email: String::from("another@example.com"),
	username: String::from("anotherusername567"),
	..user1 // specifies that the remaining fields not explicitly set should have the same value as the fields in the given instance.
};



fn build_user(email: String, username: String) -> User {
    User {
        email,
        username,
        active: true,
        sign_in_count: 1,
    }
}
```

## Using Tuple Structs without named Fields to Create Different Types

These tuple-like structs don't have names for their fields, instead they just store the data type of them.

```rust
struct Color(i32, i32, i32);
struct Point(i32, i32, i32);
let black = Color(0, 0, 0);
let origin = Point(0, 0, 0);
```

## Ownership of Struct Data

Itâ€™s possible for structs to store references to data owned by something else, but to do so requires the use of *lifetimes*.

Lifetimes ensure that the data referenced by a struct is valid for as long as the struct is.
