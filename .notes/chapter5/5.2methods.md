# Methods

Methods are functions defined within the context of a struct, enum, or trait.

* Their first parameter is always `self`, which represents the instance of the struct the method is being called on.

## Defining Methods

```rust
#[derive(Debug)]
struct Rectangle {
    width: u32,
    height: u32,
}

impl Rectangle {
    fn area(&self) -> u32 {
        self.width * self.height
    }
    
	fn can_hold(&self, other_rect: &Rectangle) -> bool {
        self.width > other_rect.width && self.height > other_rect.height
    }
}

fn main() {
    let rect1 = Rectangle { width: 30, height: 50 };
    let rect2 = Rectangle { width: 10, height: 40 };
    let rect3 = Rectangle { width: 60, height: 45 };

    println!("Can rect1 hold rect2? {}", rect1.can_hold(&rect2));
    println!("Can rect1 hold rect3? {}", rect1.can_hold(&rect3));
    println!("The area of the rectangle is {} square pixels.", rect1.area());
}
```

The main benefit of using methods instead of function is for organization.

## Associated Functions

 *Associated functions* are functions within `impl` blocks that *don’t* take `self` as a parameter. They’re still functions, not methods, because they don’t have an instance of the struct to work with.

*   An example is the `String::from` associated function.

Associated functions are often used for constructors that will return a new instance of the struct:

```rust
impl Rectangle {
    fn square(size: u32) -> Rectangle {
        Rectangle {
            width: size,
            height: size,
		}
	}
}
// To call, use :: syntax
let sq = Rectangle::square(3); 
```

## Multiple `impl` Blocks

Each struct can have multiple `impl`. While useless in this form, these are useful for generic types and traits.

```rust
impl Rectangle {
    fn area(&self) -> u32 {
        self.width * self.height
    }
}

impl Rectangle {
    fn can_hold(&self, other: &Rectangle) -> bool {
        self.width > other.width && self.height > other.heig\ht
    }
```
