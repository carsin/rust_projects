# References and Borrowing

Taking ownership and then returning ownership with every function is a bit tedious. What if we want to let a function use a value but not take ownership? It’s quite annoying that anything we pass in also needs to be passed back if we want to use it again, in addition to any data resulting from the body of the function that we might want to return as well.

It’s possible to return multiple values using a **tuple** (a collection of values of different `types`). 

```rust
fn main() {
    let s1 = String::from("hello");
    let (s2, len) = calculate_length(s1);
    println!("The length of '{}' is {}.", s2, len);
}

fn calculate_length(s: String) -> (String, usize)  {
    let length = s.len(); // len() returns the length of a String
    (s, length)
}
```

The issue with this code is that we have to return the `String` to the calling function so it can be used again to by the macro `println!`

However, it would be easier to do this using *references*.

```rust
fn main() {
    let s1 = String::from("hello");
    let len = calculate_length(&s1);
    println!("The length of '{}' is {}.", s1, len);
}

fn calculate_length(s: &String) -> usize {
    s.len()
}
```

The ampersands (&) are *references*, which refer to a value without taking ownership of it.
