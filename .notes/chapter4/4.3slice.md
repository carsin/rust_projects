# The Slice Type

Another data type that doesn't have ownership is the *slice*. Slices reference a contiguous sequence of elements in a collection rather than the whole collection.

```rust
fn first_word(s: &String) -> usize {
    let bytes = s.as_bytes(); // convert string to an array of bytes

    for (i, &item) in bytes.iter().enumerate() { // i is the index in the tuple and &item is the byte in the tuple.
        if item == b' ' {
            return i;
        }
    }

    s.len()
}
```

>   `iter` is a method that returns each element in a collection and that `enumerate` wraps the result of `iter` and returns each element as part of a tuple instead. The first element of the tuple returned from `enumerate` is the index, and the second element is a reference to the element. This is a bit more convenient than calculating the index ourselves.
