# Ownership

Ownership is Rust’s most unique feature, and it enables Rust to make memory safety guarantees without needing a garbage collector.

## What is Ownership?

Rust’s central feature is *ownership*. Memory is managed through a system of ownership with a set of rules that the compiler checks at compile time.

## Ownership Rules

-   Each value in Rust has a variable that’s called its *owner*.
-   There can only be one owner at a time.
-   When the owner goes out of scope, the value will be dropped.

### The String Type

String literals are stored on stack.

`String` is allocated on the heap, and is able to store text that is unknown at compile time
