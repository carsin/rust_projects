# The Match Control Flow Operator

`match` compares a value against a series of patterns, and then executes code based on which pattern matches. Patterns can be made up of literal values, variables, wildcards, and more. The power of `match` comes from the expressiveness of the patterns and the fact that the compiler confirms all possible cases are handled.

```rust
enum UsState {
    Alabama,
    Alaska,
}

enum Coin {
    Penny,
    Nickel,
    Dime,
    Quarter(UsState),
}

fn value_in_cents(coin: Coin) -> u8 {
    match coin {
        Coin::Penny => 1,
        Coin::Nickel => 5,
        Coin::Dime => 10,
        Coin::Quarter(state) => {
            println!("State quarter from {:?}!", state);
            25
        }
    }
}
```

## Matching with `Option<T>`

```rust
fn plus_one(x: Option<i32>) -> Option<i32> {
	match x {
		None => None,
		Some(i) => Some(i + 1),
	}
}

let five = Some(5);
let six = plus_one(five);
```

>   Combining `match` and enums is useful in many situations. You’ll see this pattern a lot in Rust code: `match` against an enum, bind a variable to the data inside, and then execute code based on it. 

## Matches Are Exhaustive

Rust knows that we didn’t cover every possible case and even knows which pattern we forgot! Matches in Rust are *exhaustive*: we must exhaust every last possibility in order for the code to be valid. Especially in the case of `Option<T>`, when Rust prevents us from forgetting to explicitly handle the `None` case, it protects us from assuming that we have a value when we might have null.

### The `_` Placeholder

```rust
    let some_u8_value = 0u8;
    match some_u8_value {
        1 => println!("one"),
        3 => println!("three"),
        5 => println!("five"),
        7 => println!("seven"),
        _ => (),
    }
```

The `_` pattern will match any value. By putting it after our other arms, the `_` will match all the possible cases that aren’t specified before it.
