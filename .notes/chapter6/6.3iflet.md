# Concise Control Flow with `if let`

The `if let` syntax combines `if` and `let` into a less verbose way to handle values that match one pattern while ignoring the rest.

```rust
if let Some(3) = some_u8_value {
	println!("three");
}
```

We can include an `else` with an `if let`. The block of code that goes with the `else` is the same as the block of code that would go with the `_` case in the `match` expression that is equivalent to the `if let` and `else`.

```rust
let mut count = 0;
if let Coin::Quarter(state) = coin {
	println!("State quarter from {:?}!", state);
} else {
	count += 1;
}
```

If you have a situation in which your program has logic that is too verbose to express using a `match`, remember that `if let` is in your Rust toolbox as well.
