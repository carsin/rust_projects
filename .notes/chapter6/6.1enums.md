# Enums and Pattern Matching

*Enumerations*, also referred to as *enums*, allow you to define a type by enumerating its possible *variants*.

```rust
enum Message {
    Quit,
    Move { x: i32, y: i32 },
    Write(String),
    ChangeColor(i32, i32, i32),
}

impl Message {
	fn call(&self) {
	// method body would be defined here
	}
}

let m = Message::Write(String::from("hello")); // Use :: when namespacing enums
m.call();
```

## The `Option` Enum and Its Advantages Over Null Values

Rust does not have nulls, but it does have an enum that can encode the concept of a value being present or absent, called `Option<T>`

```rust
enum Option<T> {
    Some(T),
    None,
}

let some_number = Some(5);
let some_string = Some("a string");

let absent_number: Option<i32> = None; // Need to input type
```

>   *<T> is a generic type paramete that means that the `Some` variant of the `Option` enum can hold one piece of data of any type*

An `Option<T>` must be converted to a `T` before performing `T` operations with it.

>   Not having to worry about incorrectly assuming a not-null value helps you to be more confident in your code. In order to have a value that can possibly be null, you must explicitly opt in by making the type of that value `Option<T>`. Then, when you use that value, you are required to explicitly handle the case when the value is null. Everywhere that a value has a type that isn’t an `Option<T>`, you *can* safely assume that the value isn’t null. This was a deliberate design decision for Rust to limit null’s pervasiveness and increase the safety of Rust code.
