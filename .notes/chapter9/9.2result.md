# Recoverable Errors with `Result`
The `Result` enum is has two variants, `Ok` and `Err`.

```rust
enum Result<T, E> {
    Ok(T),
    Err(E)
}
```

The `T` and `E` are generic type parameters.
* `T` represents the type of value that will be returned in a success case within the `Ok` variant.
* `E` represents the type of the error that will be returned in a failure case within the `Err`.
