# 9.0 Handling Errors in Rust

Rust groups errors into two major categories:
1. Recoverable: Resonable to report the problem to the user and retry. (ex: file not found)
2. Unrecoverable: Always a symptom of bugs (ex: trying to access a location beyond ht end of an array)

Most languages don't distinguish between these two kinds of errors and handle both in the same way, using mechanisms such as exceptions.
Rust doesn't have exceptions. Instead it has:
1. The type `Result<T, E>` for recoverable errors
2. The `panic!` macro that stops execution when the program encounters an unrecoverable error.
